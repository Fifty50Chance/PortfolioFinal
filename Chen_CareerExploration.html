    </section>
    <p style="text-align:center">Throughout high school, I've found various interests and hobbies that eventually led to my internet in engineering. I've participated on Dublin High School's 5327S Gael Force Robotics team which made it to Worlds in VEX 2021. Through this experience, I learned how to work with a team to create a solution to something that can be accomplished multiple ways. I also improved my dexterity skills, and made multiple friends along the way. Aside from this, I enjoy watching videos about AI learning in my free time. I think it's very impressive that over the course of millions of trials, AI can learn to solve problems on their own and learn from their own mistakes. I've also attended multiple summer camps that allowed me to expand upon my knowledge of engineering. This ranges from potential minors such as neuroscience to more relaxing classes such as building LEGO robots and writing code for them to accomplish a task. In my future, I plan to attend a college such as UC Davis, so I can continue exploring my interest in engineering from there.

      <h4 style="text-align-center">Made by Sihan Chen</h4>
      <h4 style="text-align-center">Class: IED</h4>
      <p style="text-align-center">In the Marble Maze Project, I was given a small box and a certain amount of cardboard. The instructions were to create a small game that would not only fit inside the box, but not use more than the amount of material given. Throughout the first stage of the project, I had learned to improve my Autodesk Inventor skills by designing the game within the program. In the second part of the project, my job was to create a physical copy of the game given the actual materials. Through this experience, I had learned skills such as measuring and cutting precisely, and improved upon my hand-eye coordination skills.

      <h4 style="text-align:center">Class: CSP</h4>
      <p style="text-align:center;">In this project, Kadam and I had used the MIT App Inventor tutorial in order to construct the basic outline of code for the game. However, we were not fully satisfied with the final product that MIT App Inventor offered, so through collaboration and hard work, we were able to add additional features, such as adding a speed the ball must be going under in order to go into the hole, a main menu, and changing the shape and color of the barrier.

      <h4 style="text-align:center;">Made by Sihan Chen</h4>
      <h4 style="text-align:center">Class: IED</h4>
      <p style="text-align:center;">In the PalmPilot project, I had to measure the parts of a PalmPilot and make one in Autodesk Inventor based off my measurements on the physical product. Through these experiences, I learned to measure things accurately and further improved my Autodesk Inventor skills, but the most important skill I had learned was to improvise and adapt, because the measurements could not always be perfect so the product within Inventor was not perfect either, and so I had to modify some measurements within Autodesk slightly to achieve my desired final product. Below is a picture is a picture of the PalmPilot in Autodesk Inventor.

      <h4 style="text-align:center">Made by Sihan Chen, Edison Chan, Apollo Heo, and Alexander Xin</h4>
      <h4 style="text-align:center">Class: POE</h4>
      <p style="text-align:center">In this project, all four members worked to complete a complex machine composed of three different simple machines. After completing our individual complex machines and creating a recording of how the machine works, Edison Chan put together a final video showcasing how all of the complex machines worked together to deliver various items, being an eraser, pencil, calculator, and piece of paper, to the user in order to quickly set them up to do homework. My complex machine was composed of a wedge, a lever, and finaly an inclined plane in order to give the user an eraser. The ball would be pushed by the wedge, which dropped on a lever, causing both the eraser and the ball to slide down an inclined plane and giving the user the eraser. Through this project, I learned better time management, working to find alternate solutions when the initial idea did not work out as expected, and good teamwork, as we met online every few days to discuss what was finished and what still needed to be done, and that is how we got the project done early.

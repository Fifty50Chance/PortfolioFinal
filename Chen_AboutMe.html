          <!--Small intro about me-->
          <p style="text-align:center">Hello! My name is Sihan Chen, and I am currently a senior in Dublin High School. I am interested in the the STEM field, and am currently 17 years old. Some hobbies I particularly enjoy are playing with Rubiks Cubes, reading novels, and playing video games. One other interest I have is chess. Some careers that interest me are anesthesiologist, architecture, and IT technician. Lastly, I enjoy learning languages, such as German and other European languages.

          Out of school, I do volunteer work with GLIFY (Global Leadership Initiative For Youth) where I do all sorta of things, such as sorting medical supplies with Medshare, teaching English to students in Ecuador (Project Cuenca), packing and giving out food with Kids Against Hunger, and sometimes help with local gardens when I'm working with Fertile Groundworks. 

          During the Spring of 2021, I worked with Meaningful Teens on Project Cuenca, where for four months I tutored students in Ecuador, Cuenca, in order to improve their profiency in English. Over this time volunteering, I learned to communicate well and deal with unexpected situations.

          <!--School achivements-->
          Some of my achievements within school are being awarded a plaque in Smarts Mill Middle School in my 7th grade year for "Outstanding German Student" and achieving the maximum score on the Grammar section for the SOL (Standards of Learning, essentially the final exam for middle schoolers in Virginia). IN addition to this, my applications to the Academy of Science (AOS) and Academy of Engineering and Technology (AET) in Virginia had both been accepted. Lastly, I had also won a schoolwide chess competition in my 7th grade year.

          In 10th grade, I had around a 3.8 GPA, and was in the school orchestra. I was also in the robotics club because I enjoy engineering. In this year, I learned how to code a bit of html and css.

          In 11th grade, despite having to online school, I continued my passion for engineering by taking the Honors Principles of Engineering class at Dublin High School. I also became part of the Gael Force Robotics competitive team, and as a team we made our way to the VEX Worlds competition. Being part of the team taught me how to work better with others, and improvise and create solutions.

          I am currently in 12th grade and I take Honors Digital Electronics to pursue a STEM career. In addition to this, I am taking courses that I believe will help in the future, such as AP Calculus BC and AP Physics.
          
          I scored a 780 on Math 2 Subject Test and later, a 1550 on the SAT in November of 2020.

          <!--Hobbies-->
          I have a profound interest in solving Rubiks Cubes and its variations. In 5th grade, my friend had introduced me to the 3x3 (Rubiks Cube). Since then, I had bought multiple other cubes and variations and had learned to solve them over time, and still retain this hobby to this day. I also enjoy reading mystery and crime novels, in particular, James Patterson novels. I also do read Ridley Pearson's novels on certain occasions, but reading, regardless of author, is definitely something I enjoy very much.

          One of my hobbies is playing cello. I've played cello for about 4 years now, and have attended a few recitals, and once even played music at a senior center. I have learned a few Bach cello suites, and other various songs as well.
